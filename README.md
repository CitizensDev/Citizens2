CitizensAPI README
==================

CitizensAPI is an API framework for developers to use. It provides methods for creating and maintaining NPCs, as well as attaching custom data to NPCs.

Compatible With:
- All versions of Minecraft with Spigot/Bukkit (http://wiki.citizensnpcs.co/Versions for more)

Maven
=====

IF YOU ARE USING THE API (which you probably should **not** be if you're just integrating the Citizens plugin!), Include CitizensAPI in your pom.xml like this: (If you are integrating your own plugin with the Citizens plugin, see https://wiki.citizensnpcs.co/API for information on appropriate maven linkage.)
```xml
<repository>
            <id>citizens-repo</id>
            <url>https://maven.citizensnpcs.co/repo</url>
</repository>
<dependency>
	<groupId>net.citizensnpcs</groupId>
	<artifactId>citizensapi</artifactId>
	<version>CITIZENS_VERSION</version>
	<type>jar</type>
	<scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

The correct CITIZENS_VERSION to use can depend on your minecraft version. A list can be found here https://maven.citizensnpcs.co/#/repo/net/citizensnpcs/ - or you can use the version listed in the Citizens2 JAR you downloaded (e.g. `2.0.30-SNAPSHOT`).
